## Hall Of Fame ðŸŽ‰

- Many thanks to [Miniduikboot](https://github.com/miniduikboot) for
  helping me test the mod. Miniduikboot is a great developer and you
  should check out some of their projects. I promise you won't
  regret it ðŸ˜‰ (they have a great plugin for Impostor which makes
  the lobby codes actual words. Pretty POG if you ask me ðŸ‘€).
- Many thanks to [amsyarasyiq](https://github.com/amsyarasyiq) for helping fix
  an annoying bug which caused normal RPCs to be used instead of
  custom ones. If they hadn't found a fix, I probably would still be
  working on trying to fix the mod ðŸ˜…. They also contributed to this
  mod at one point but I destroyed their commits when doing a force
  push to the repo...
